1) Figure out way to be able to identify more than one color band in an image
    a. Could dilate pixels and close holes, then erode back to normal size
    b. Then do blob detection to find how many blobs of that particular color band (only count blobs if  > certain area of pixels)
  
2) Print out color-checker image and color-checker image with values printed 
    a. Use this for color calibration
    b. Each color block is separated, so should do blob detection and labeling of each block
        i.   Find the center of each individual block
        ii.  Then take an average of a block of pixels using that center
    c. Then make adjustments accordingly 
        i.   Because each color is known, take an average of a block of pixels within each block of the color-checker image
        ii.  Then compare the calculated value to the theoretical value, and save the offsets
        iii. Use the offsets for upper and lower color boundaries OR for adjusting the colors within the image
