1) Figure out way to be able to identify more than one color band in an image
    a. Could dilate pixels and close holes, then erode back to normal size
    b. Then do blob detection to find how many blobs of that particular color band (only count blobs if  > certain area of pixels)
  
2) Compare actual vs. theoretical color checker image and adjust accordingly (possible adjusting gamma correction?)

3) First & foremost, make sure color ranges are accurate and include all possibilities for best result
