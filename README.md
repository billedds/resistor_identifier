# resistor_identifier

This repository is for a project designed to identify a resistor based on the color-coded bars. The overall goal of the project is to first test and create a program to accomplish the task in Python & OpenCV (Raspberry Pi 3 is used for testing purposes). 

After finishing this first task, an Android app. will be made with a friendly user-interface and ideally the Python script can still be used. There is a version of OpenCV for Java / Android development, but Python is much more user-friendly. 

Eventually, a program running on a Raspberry Pi will be able to take a picture of a circuit board and analyze all of the components found using OpenCV. The program will then link to websites with prices and create a BOM (bill of material) with a list of all components found, links, and prices.
